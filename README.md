# **Java Spring Framework 6, Spring Boot 3, Spring cloud, Spring AI & Microservices Learning Journey**
Overview

This repository documents my learning and hands-on practice with core Java backend development and Spring ecosystem concepts through the Telusko Udemy course. It covers end-to-end enterprise-level application development using Spring Boot, Microservices, and related frameworks.

The goal of this learning path was to build a strong foundation in Java backend technologies, understand how enterprise systems are structured, and gain practical experience with real-time development tools and techniques.

## **Technologies & Frameworks Covered**
Core Java & Tools

Java (OOPs, Collections, Streams, Exception Handling)

Data Structures and Algorithms

Git & GitHub (Version Control and Branching)

## **Spring Ecosystem**

**Spring Framework** – Core concepts, Dependency Injection, Inversion of Control

**Spring MVC** – Model-View-Controller architecture for web applications

**Spring Boot** – Simplified setup, auto-configuration, and REST API development

**Spring Data JPA & Hibernate** – ORM, entity relationships, and database integration

**Spring AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming)** – Cross-cutting concerns (logging, security)

**Spring Transactions** – Transaction management and rollback handling

**Spring Caching** – Performance optimization using caching mechanisms

**Spring Batch** – Batch processing for large data sets

## **Security & Authentication**

**Spring Security** – Authentication, authorization, and CSRF protection

**JWT (JSON Web Token)** – Token-based authentication for REST APIs

## **Microservices & Cloud**

**Spring Cloud** – Distributed microservices design patterns

**Service Discovery** (Eureka), API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway)

Centralized Configuration, Load Balancing, and Resilience concepts

## **Key Learning Outcomes**

Gained expertise in building RESTful APIs using Spring Boot

Learned end-to-end project structure: Controller → Service → Repository → Entity

Implemented secure authentication using Spring Security and JWT

Developed microservices with Spring Cloud for scalability and fault tolerance

Integrated databases using JPA and Hibernate

Understood transaction management, caching, and batch processing

Practiced version control and collaborative workflow using Git

## **Sample Projects Implemented**

Banking Application – Account management, deposit/withdrawal transactions

E-Commerce System – Product ordering and inventory management

JWT Authentication API – Secure login system using Spring Security

Microservices Demo – Service registry, API gateway, and inter-service communication

## **Tools Used**

IntelliJ IDEA

Maven

MySQL / H2 Database

Postman

Git & GitHub
